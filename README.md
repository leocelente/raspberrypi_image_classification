# TensorFlow Lite Python classification example with Pi Camera
## My notes
NOTE:: Pillow and numpy installation on Raspberry-Pi requires some dependencies that are no automatic. Refer to [this issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14532#issuecomment-549165359) and [this issue](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/3077#issuecomment-469078718)


This example uses [TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite) with Python
on a Raspberry Pi to perform real-time image classification using images
streamed from the Pi Camera.

Although the TensorFlow model and nearly all the code in here can work with
other hardware, the code in `classify_picamera.py` uses the [`picamera`](
https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) API to capture images from the Pi
Camera. So you can modify those parts of the code if you want to use a different
camera input.


## Set up your hardware

Before you begin, you need to [set up your Raspberry Pi](
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up) with
Raspbian (preferably updated to Buster).

You also need to [connect and configure the Pi Camera](
https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/camera.md).

And to see the results from the camera, you need a monitor connected
to the Raspberry Pi. It's okay if you're using SSH to access the Pi shell
(you don't need to use a keyboard connected to the Pi)â€”you only need a monitor
attached to the Pi to see the camera stream.


## Install the TensorFlow Lite runtime

In this project, all you need from the TensorFlow Lite API is the `Interpreter`
class. So instead of installing the large `tensorflow` package, we're using the
much smaller `tflite_runtime` package.

To install this on your Raspberry Pi, follow the instructions in the
[Python quickstart](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python).
Return here after you perform the `pip install` command.


## Download the example files

First, clone this Git repo onto your Raspberry Pi like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/examples --depth 1
```

Then use our script to install a couple Python packages, and
download the MobileNet model and labels file:

```
cd examples/lite/examples/image_classification/raspberry_pi

# The script takes an argument specifying where you want to save the model files
bash download.sh /tmp
```


## Run the example

```
python3 classify_picamera.py \
  --model /tmp/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tflite \
  --labels /tmp/labels_mobilenet_quant_v1_224.txt
```

You should see the camera feed appear on the monitor attached to your Raspberry
Pi. Put some objects in front of the camera, like a coffee mug or keyboard, and
you'll see the predictions printed. It also prints the amount of time it took
to perform each inference in milliseconds.

[TensorFlow Lite inference](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference).
